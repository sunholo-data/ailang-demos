This document is a test for the AILANG DocParse demo, featuring headings, paragraphs, lists, and a table. AILANG offers pure functional XML parsing, AI-augmented layout understanding, and bounded costs via capability budgets. Its features include type-safe, contract-verified document parsing with bounded AI costs, and emphasizes the elegance of pattern matching on XML trees over imperative DOM traversal. A table titled "Sample Data Table" is present but contains no data. No images are included in the document.
