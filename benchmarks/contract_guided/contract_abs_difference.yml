  export pure func absDiff(a: int, b: int) -> int
    ensures { result >= 0 }

task_prompt: |
  Write an AILANG module with a pure function `absDiff(a, b)` that returns
  the absolute difference between two integers.

  Include a main function that prints (one per line):
    absDiff(10, 3)
    absDiff(3, 10)
    absDiff(5, 5)
