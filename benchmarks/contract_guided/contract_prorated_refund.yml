contract_spec: |
  export pure func proratedRefund(price: int, daysUsed: int, warrantyDays: int) -> int
    requires { price >= 0, daysUsed >= 0, warrantyDays >= 1 }
    ensures { result >= 0 }

task_prompt: |
  Write an AILANG module with `proratedRefund(price, daysUsed, warrantyDays)`.

  Computes a refund proportional to the remaining warranty period:
    refund = price * (warrantyDays - daysUsed) / warrantyDays

  But if the customer contacts support AFTER the warranty expires,
  daysUsed > warrantyDays makes the numerator negative.

  The contract says result >= 0 — you must handle the post-warranty case.

  Include a main function that prints (one per line):
    proratedRefund(365, 100, 365)
    proratedRefund(1000, 0, 30)
    proratedRefund(500, 400, 365)
    proratedRefund(100, 500, 365)

expected_stdout: |
  265
  1000
  0
  0
